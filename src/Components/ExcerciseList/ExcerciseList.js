    description: `Alternating oblique sit-ups are a medium-impact exercise that focuses on strengthening the muscles responsible for rotating your torso. The benefits of this exercise are increased strength and flexibility in your internal and external obliques. To perform this exercise, you should lie on your back on an exercise mat with slightly bent knees and make sure that your feet are flat on the mat. Your hips should be parallel to the floor and your shoulder blades should be flat against the mat as well. Place your fingers behind your ears and take a deep breath in. Inhale deeply immediately before you begin your first sit up. This should be a relatively long, slow, natural inhale. Begin by bracing your abdominal muscles. Keep your neck and back straight as you breathe out and pull your shoulder toward your inner thigh, while keeping your lower leg parallel with the floor. Twist your torso to touch your right elbow to your left knee. Make sure to contract the muscles in your lower abdomen in order to close the gap between your pelvis and lower rib cage instead of just moving your arm. You should feel a slight burning sensation around the side of your lower torso as you do this exercise. At no point should your elbow come into your line of vision. Pause while staying in position for two seconds with your abs contracted as your elbow touches your knee. This should be a bit challenging and should make the side of your abdomen burn with growing intensity. Exhale slowly as you lay back down on the mat. You should now be laying in the position you started in. Repeat on the other side `,

To perform this exercise, you should stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips until your torso is almost parallel to the floor. Your arms should be hanging straight down from your shoulders with your palms facing each other. Keeping your arms straight, lift the weights out to the sides until they reach shoulder height. Pause for a moment before slowly lowering the weights back down to the starting position .`,
